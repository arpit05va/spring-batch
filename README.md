# spring-batch
This project demonstrates a Spring Batch job that reads data from a CSV file, processes it by converting names to uppercase, and writes it to a database using Spring Boot and JPA. It showcases chunk-based processing with clear separation of reader, processor, and writer, ideal for learning batch data handling.
